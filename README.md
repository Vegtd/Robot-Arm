## 📌 Overview
This project is a **robotic arm design** developed for educational, prototyping, and automation purposes.  
The arm features a multi-joint structure with a gripper end-effector, suitable for simulations, 3D printing, and further hardware integration.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Design a functional robotic arm with realistic joint movement  
- Enable easy modification and future upgrades  
- Support learning in robotics, mechanics, and CAD design  

## 🦾 Features
- Multi-axis articulated arm  
- Gripper-based end effector  
- Modular joint design  
- Compact and stable base  
- Ready for servo motor integration  

## 🧱 Materials (Recommended)
- PLA+ or PETG for structural parts  
- Metal screws and bearings for joints  
- Servo motors (e.g., MG996 / MG955)  

## ⚙️ Assembly Notes
- Ensure proper alignment of joints before tightening screws  
- Test joint movement without motors first  
- Use supports when 3D printing complex overhangs  

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add servo motor control  
- Microcontroller integration (Arduino / ESP32)  
- Inverse kinematics support  
- ROS compatibility
